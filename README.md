# CS-305

Artemis Financial wanted insight on properly securing their files and customer information. I think I did a great job in recommending the best ecurity considering teh companies stance and what they do. It is important to code securely and maintian those practices, so that confidential information does not leak to the public. It is even more important for companies that withold any kind of customer information. The most dificult part of the vulnerability assessment is getting the computer to work with itself to do so. To increase layers of security, increasing bits and adding keys to important information allows companies to withhold info to a need to know basis. To make sure the code is functional, I kept to industry standards and kept it as precise as I knew how. From this assignement, I would show the ability to comprehend the best choice of security based off the limited information given. I believe it shows an insight into what secures files effectively rather than what is just available.
